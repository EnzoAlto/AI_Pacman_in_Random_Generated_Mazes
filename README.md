Definition of PACMAN:
Pac-Man is a maze game where players navigate a character to consume every food pellet on the screen. The primary challenge is to avoid a team of ghosts, though special capsules grant the temporary power to turn the tables and eat them. A level is completed once all the pellets have been consumed. See Pacman_LT2_AI_Base.ipynb to run the components of the code.

The project began with the basic goal of building the world of PACMAN AI from scratch using Pygame. The first steps were to construct the maze, create a controllable PACMAN AI, and establish a clear win condition for a new game. At the heart of the experience, however, is the creation of a team of four ghosts, each designed with a unique personality and individual movement pattern to hunt the player down.
Leading the charge is Blinky (Red), "The Chaser". As the most aggressive of the group, he relentlessly targets Pac-Man's current position and grows faster as the game progresses. He is followed by Pinky (Pink), "The Ambusher," who prefers a more strategic approach by aiming four tiles ahead of PACMAN AI's direction to set a trap. Pinky's logic has a famous bug: if PACMAN AI faces up, her target is four tiles up and four tiles left due to a sign error in the code.
The most unpredictable member is Inky (Cyan), "The Tricky One". His targeting is a complex calculation that combines Blinky's position with a point two tiles ahead of PACMAN AI, creating a vector that is then doubled to determine his final target. This reliance on two different characters makes him difficult to predict. Finally, there is Clyde (Orange), known for "The Feint". His behavior is situational: if he is more than eight tiles away from PACMAN AI, he chases aggressively like Blinky, but if he gets any closer, he retreats to his scatter corner in the bottom-left of the maze. This causes him to constantly weave between chasing and fleeing.
To motivate the player, a scoring system was implemented. Each regular food dot consumed awards 10 points, while a power capsule grants 50 points. Eating a power capsule turns the tables, allowing PACMAN AI to hunt the ghosts. Eating the first scared ghost yields 200 points, with the reward doubling for each additional ghost chomped during the same power period, escalating from 400 to 800, and finally to 1600 points. The entire implementation of this agent is contained in the Pacman_AI_LT2_v2.py script.

Maze Generation
The generator builds a single-width–corridor PACMAN AI maze by initializing an all-wall grid with odd dimensions, carving an “ideal symmetric maze” on the odd-cell lattice using a randomized depth-first backtracker that removes walls between cells two steps apart, then “braiding” the result by opening walls at dead ends until every corridor tile has degree ≥ 2 (adding loops). It overlays regularly spaced horizontal and vertical avenues to create long escape lanes and optionally mirrors the layout for vertical or horizontal symmetry. PACMAN AI is placed near the top center on the first available corridor, ghosts are clustered on a corridor row near the bottom, and power capsules are positioned on an evenly spaced interior grid and nudged via a small BFS to the nearest corridor; remaining spaces are filled with pellets and emitted as ASCII (#, ., o, P, G). Crucially, on each environment reset, we draw a new random seed, so a fresh maze is generated every time, forcing the PACMAN AI agent to generalize across diverse topologies rather than overfitting to a single map. In a nutshell, this approach provides an appropriate training environment that can be considered both fairly challenging and has a high rate of variability. This can reinforce learning and testing generalization for different iterations of the game. 

Reference Reflex Agent Concept
This part details a strategic PACMAN AI designed to win by making intelligent decisions in a constantly changing maze. The agent operates on a scoring system that balances risks and rewards; it avoids ghosts by applying penalties based on their proximity while being drawn towards pellets and capsules. It applies a high-threat penalty for ghosts one tile away and a medium penalty for those two to four tiles away. To ensure adaptability, the maze is procedurally regenerated at every reset, and simulations are accelerated for performance testing.
To enhance its performance, the agent uses two advanced strategies. A "Breadcrumb Memory" module gives it spatial awareness to avoid getting stuck in repetitive loops, often called the "ping pong effect," and encourages efficient exploration. Additionally, a "Conservative Capsule Strategy" makes the agent prioritize collecting pellets instead of immediately chasing vulnerable ghosts, ensuring power-ups are used for maximum long-term benefit. The entire implementation of this agent is contained in the Pacman_AI_LT2_v2corner.py script.

A 40%-win rate against “hardest-difficulty” ghosts that stay in constant chase is a strong starting point. The challenge already requires Pac-Man to time power-pellet consumption to maximize frightened-mode windows while harvesting pellets safely; however, performance is constrained by a high-dimensional (up to 39 tunable parameters), tightly coupled parameter space (e.g., danger radii, flee/chase weights, lookahead depth, pellet vs. capsule priority, corner-cutting risk). Maze randomization further reduces the value of map-specific heuristics, demanding policies that generalize across layouts. To push the win rate higher, introduce systematic parameter optimization: (1) use a Genetic Algorithm to evolve weight vectors and thresholds, with a fitness function combining win rate, average survival time, pellets per second, and penalty for risky deaths; include domain randomization over seeds and ghost policies to avoid overfitting; and (2) run large Monte Carlo rollouts (or MCTS-style lookahead) to tune horizon length and action priors, estimating expected return under stochastic ghost responses. Complement this with improved ghost prediction—learned transition models or short-horizon simulators that account for line-of-sight, scatter/chase tendencies, and likely interception/trap points (common cause of death)—so the evaluation function can score moves by predicted encounter risk, not just static distance. Together, these changes can yield a smarter and more robust Pacman that adapts its direction decisions to shifting mazes and relentlessly pursuing ghosts.

Performance Validation:
To validate the AI agent's adaptability on a suite of dynamically generated maps, the batch_runner.py script was developed as a critical evaluation tool. This script executes the agent against a large-scale, procedurally generated map set, using a variety of seeds to create diverse and unpredictable environments for a comprehensive performance assessment. By quantifying the agent's win rate across numerous trials, this data-driven approach moves beyond anecdotal observation to provide a statistically robust indicator of the AI's strategic efficacy and generalization capabilities.
